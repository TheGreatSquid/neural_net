# neural_net
A neural network framework using numpy, by TheGreatSquid and Anlonymous :)
Currently the objective is number-image recognition.

## branch "module-based"
This branch has the goal of separating the underlying NN framework from the image application. To do this, move the `neural_net_mod1.py` file to the path given by running `python sys.path` in the terminal, and then removing the "1" off the name. Make sure the import is for `neural_net_mod.py` in `neural_net.py`. Then, wait for a future commit which removes the obsolete file.
